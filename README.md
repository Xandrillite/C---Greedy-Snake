# C---Greedy-Snake
> A tiny game completely written in C
At this moment, I have just began learning C programming for about less than half a year, and this project is just for college homework.
The entire logic is mainly done by myself, and by searching all the Internet for usage of various functions and libs in C language, I finally be able to complete this project.
--- 
In this project, I used `windows.h` to show graphics in cmd window(maybe this could not be called as graphics). Before this, I have searched a lot. But because of my ignorance, I thought some of them are used in C++ or just I can't understand how to use them, I chose `windows.h`.
With `windows.h`, I can move the cursor to any point I prefer and hide it for beauty. Based on this, I print a `*` where every section of the snake indicates, which form the snake's body.
And the background is just print boundry lines with two loop.
But there is still a bug that I can't solve. When I use wasd to control the snake, it will turn its head immediately. But when I use arrow keys to control it, it will move another time before change the direction. 
I will be glad if you can contact with me for academic communications, giving some advice or even solving the problem mentioned above.
Thank you for reading this and wish you more progress.
